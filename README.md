This repository contains my labs for DCS290: Principles of Compilers, which is lectured by [Prof. Shen](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/5430) (Minghua Shen) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn). We are required to upload and opensource our code on github.

Labs are under different branches.
- [Lab1: Lexical Analysis](https://github.com/lixk28/kric/tree/lab1)

All the code and materials are for reference only for now.
